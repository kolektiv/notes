# Wizards.

## Actual, honest to god, wizards.

Once, long ago (or possibly far in the future, nobody was entirely sure), there was a small - but happy - kingdom. This was only a very small kingdom, but it did have a capital city, set on the coast so that on one side of the city was lush pastoral land turning to thick forest in the distance, while on the other was a startlingly blue and sparkling sea that stretched toward an empty horizon.

The people of this kingdom were carefree and content. Life was easy, and living well took almost no effort at all. This was all down to wizardry, for the city was set not only in a beautiful landscape but in a reality where magic was commonplace. Over the centuries that the kingdom had prospered, wizards had developed spells for everything the people could need.

Breakfast and a clean set of clothes? There was a spell for that. Travelling across the city to meet a friend for a light brunch? Another for that. Watching the latest fashionable diversion or enjoying a show created just for you? Yet another spell (or two). Life was good, and as one might guess from this small sample of spells, work wasn’t really a thing.

Of course, no kingdom is ever perfect. The spells were incredible, but they weren’t always 100% accurate. They usually did roughly what you wanted, but sometimes people would find themselves having to say the spell twice, or to modify it a little to add more (or less) politeness, or perhaps to give an example of another spell that was quite like the one they intended so that the magic would know what they meant.

The people were used to this, of course; they started learning spells from their very first day in school, and by the time they reached adulthood (a distinction which was of little meaning, incidentally), they all knew hundreds of spells, enough to live their own life of comfort and ease. In fact, some of the smartest people in the kingdom knew all of the spells there were!

As it happened, one person was not quite as happy and content as the rest. She was a young woman nearing the end of her school days and looking without much enthusiasm at the years ahead. She had a habit, quite upsetting to her teachers and family, of asking questions that didn’t make much sense (to them, at least). Questions like “How do I make my breakfast spell boil my eggs for longer?” or “How can I get my clothing spell to give me some extra pockets once in a while?”. Sometimes, when she veered from the correct words of the spell, she found she could get some of these things, but it rarely worked twice, and often even the very same spell would do something different tomorrow.

She’d started asking questions as a very small child, and while everyone around her thought (and hoped) she’d grow out of it, she showed little sign of stopping. She even asked some of the questions that everyone else knew were a little ridiculous to ask, such as how you could create new spells (nobody knew, and nobody had created a new spell for as long as anyone could remember) or - worse still - how the spells actually did what they did, which was universally agreed not to matter - they did it, and that was what counted.

Being a smart young woman, she’d started to look for answers to her questions herself. She’d even found an old museum in a quiet and almost forgotten street near the middle of the city.

This museum contained many ancient things, things which seemed to be from before all of the spells were known. Some of them were recognisable - a pot was a pot, for example, whether it was sitting on a dusty shelf or magically appearing with your dinner already cooked in it, although the one on the shelf couldn’t be magical - they disappeared after you’d eaten. How you could make a pot without a spell was a mystery, but clearly, someone had.

Most of the other items in the museum were utterly baffling; each item had a card with a name and description, but they didn’t make much sense. The spell for describing and explaining an object veered towards the unreliable, and the cards in the museum were often nonsensical or duplicates of other cards. Many of the items were simply labelled “fire hydrant”, “bicycle”, “bridge”, or “pedestrian crossing” - names which meant nothing to begin with and clearly couldn’t apply to all the many disparate objects to which they were affixed. Still, the young woman spent hours there hoping to understand more.

Now, reality (even a magical reality) being what it is, not everything in the kingdom was peace and happiness. Like anywhere that life is good and easy, and where life might not be so good and easy in other parts of the world, tensions sometimes arose. Invaders from neighbouring kingdoms would sometimes appear from those far forests and sweep across the pastoral land, hoping to seize the city (and the easy life) for themselves. Armed, angry, and caring not-at-all for the brunches they might be about to spoil, they stormed towards the city.

Thankfully for those whose brunches were at risk, those long-ago wizards had seen this coming. They had left an absolute arsenal of defensive spells for repelling anything that might suddenly appear on that wooded horizon. The city’s people took it in turn to form a relatively leisurely militia responsible for spotting the invasions and putting the spells into action as needed. And what spells they were! Spells to set the land ablaze under the invaders’ feet, spells to turn the earth to quicksand or sucking mud, spells to turn the trees themselves into gnarled and powerful defenders. In short, try as they might; the invaders never got all that far.

One day, the questioning young woman was doing something she often did: looking out over that shimmering sea and wondering. Wondering where the waves came from, and why they were bigger on some days than others. Wondering what was under the waves and how she might be able to see it. Wondering what was beyond that empty horizon and how she might get there. As she wondered this last, she suddenly realised that the empty horizon was not, as it always was, empty. There were boats out there.

Now, the city had boats. They were a coastal city, after all, and boats were handy. They needed somewhere to stand when they said the spells which gave them fish; after all, those spells only ever seemed to work on a boat. These boats were not the same. They were huge, and there were so many! They didn’t look like the city’s cheerful, magically painted boats either. They looked… angry. She wasn’t quite sure why she thought that, but it was still clear that these boats were not good news. She ran into the city to tell the militia.

The people currently forming the militia were not stupid. They, too, looked at the boats and didn’t like them one bit. It was time to break out the defensive spells.

The spell to set the land ablaze under the invaders’ feet turned out to be less effective at sea. Other than a neighbouring kingdom finding that the lobsters they pulled up the following day arrived pre-cooked, there seemed to be little impact. Likewise, turning the sea into mud proved disappointing, and the lack of trees precluded the use of many of the more physical spells.

The young woman shouted at the militia. “We need different spells!” But the militia looked confused. “Come on! Maybe if we combine some of our other spells?” She shouted. But nobody really knew how to do that. At that moment, she had a new idea. “We need our own fighting boats! Quickly! Make fighting boats!” But nobody knew of such a spell. She thought of the objects in the museum and wondered whether the boats out at sea (though closer now) were magical or somehow something like the objects created some other way.

The young woman looked about her at the helpless militia. She considered running through the city, shouting for anyone who might know anything about how to create a fighting boat, but she already knew what she’d find (or rather, wouldn’t find).

She ran through the city and set off across the pastoral land towards the distant forests. She turned back as she reached the line of trees to see the city behind her in the distance, the fighting boats on the shore. She turned her back one last time and started for whatever neighbouring kingdom she might find. Perhaps there’d be brunch.
